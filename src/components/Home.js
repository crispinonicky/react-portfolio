        I've completed my Bachelors' in Arts in Psychology at Wake Forest
        University, graduating in the Spring semester of 2018. I am currently
        enrolled at Ironhack's Web development bootcamp in Miami.
        <br />
        <br />I pursued psychology to better understand people, and I've found
        that it's helped me in my everyday life. However, I've decided to change
        my focus to coding, which is why I enrolled in Ironhack.

        Specialties: JavaScript, Node.js, React.js, MongoDB, Express, HTML, CSS
